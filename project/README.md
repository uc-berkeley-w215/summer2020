# W215 Course Project Guidelines

You will design a research protocol to evaluate human behaviors or
attitudes that impact security or privacy in computing systems, writing
up the protocol as if it were an (incomplete) research paper and
presentation. (Incomplete because you will not have time to run the
study or get results.)

Pilot any components that can be piloted in the
time available, and/or use peers from other project groups to identify
ways to improve your protocol. Project groups will be either 2-3 people.

Be proactive about talking with the instructor before the project
proposal is due in case you have chosen a topic that is out of scope or
not well-scoped.

You may use the class’s running list of [<span class="underline">project
ideas</span>](./ideas.md).

**You will want to get started early**, seek feedback early, pilot
early, and leave time for many revisions of your study materials. In the
words of a former student in this course after submitting a successful
project:

> *This is tough. Every time I take another pass at this I see more
> things I want to change. Are the studies you work on always this
> iterative? How do you know when you're actually ready to deploy?*

In fact, most studies designed by researchers with decades of experience
will go through more iterations than you have time for during this term,
often with over a dozen iterations of test materials and two to four
pilot studies. One of the things you will be learning this term is that
the human-subjects studies you read are the results of lots of work
you are unlikely to read about in the paper, and far more work than most people
understand.

**New this term**, we have a budget of $100/student for running studies,
so you can pay participants via such services as
[<span class="underline">Qualtrics</span>](https://berkeley.ca1.qualtrics.com/)
or Amazon’s Mechanical Turk.

## Deliverables 

**Assignment for Class 6**

In the breakout group projects that we started during class 3 and
presented in class 4, I hope you all learned that:

1.  > Understanding the specifics of a problem is an essential first
    > step and worth your time.  
    > (Much confusion resulted when team members didn’t see the problem
    > the same way.)

2.  > Different assumptions of costs and benefits can lead to very
    > different research designs.

Therefore, when you are pitching projects ideas, put 80% of your effort
into writing a crisp and clear definition of the problem you want to
investigate or hypothesis you wish to test, and then 20% of effort into
saying which research method (survey, lab study, field study, etc.)
would best apply to the problem.

What decisions do you intend the results of your study to inform? For example, is there a technology that you or others might choose to adopt or avoid based on the results of a study?  Are you identifying pain points or challenges that will help you or your organization determine which problems still need to be addressed in a design?  Will you be identifying users concerns so that you can better quantify them with a follow-up study so that they can be address down the road?  In short, what are the possible benefits of this study?

Please submit at least two paragraphs before the sync session, and be
prepared to answer questions about what you wrote. Send a link to your
proposal to the slack group.

**Unit 8, before the live session**

1.  > A one-page project proposal (10% of course grade).

**Unit 14, before the live session**

1.  > Research materials needed to execute the study:
    
    1.  > study/analysis plan
    
    2.  > research protocols
    
    3.  > any material required during the research activities (surveys,
        > recruiting ads, etc.)

2.  > Designs, mockups, and prototypes at the appropriate level of
    > fidelity.

3.  > Documentation of piloting the study protocol with at least two
    > individuals (Groups of size \>=2).

4.  > A final paper giving an overview of the proposed study, what you
    > hope to learn from it, and what you learned from the pilot study.
    
    1.  > Motivation
    
    2.  > Related work
    
    3.  > Methodology  
        > Ensure your discussion covers foreseeable risks section, with
        > this example requirement *from UW’s IRB Application:*

> Describe the reasonably foreseeable risks of harm, discomforts, and
> hazards to the subjects and others of the research procedures. For
> each harm, discomfort, or hazard:
> 
> •Describe the magnitude, probability, duration, and/or reversibility
> of the harm, discomfort, or hazard, AND
> 
> •Describe how the risks will be reduced or managed
> 
> •Consider possible physical, psychological, social, legal, and
> economic harms, including possible negative effects on financial
> standing, employability, insurability, educational advancement or
> reputation.

4.  > Results section (forge some results assuming things go wrong)

<!-- end list -->

5.  > A final project presentation covering a subset of the final paper.

**Unit 8, before the live session**

1.  > A one-page project proposal.

**Unit 10, before the live session**

> Revised proposal

**Unit 12, before the live session**

> Presentation of preliminary study design

**Unit 14**

Each group will share their project with the class. Be prepared to
cover:

1.  > Which topic did you choose, and what are the research questions?

2.  > Which research method did you choose, and why?

3.  > What material did you prepare for the study?

4.  > What would be your recruiting plan and target demographics if you
    > were to complete the research?

5.  > What were the results of the pilot sessions (at least 2 people)
    > and how did the experience influence the research materials?

**Two days after Class 14**

Your group will submit a final paper describing your research plans and
the results of the pilot. All necessary research materials should be
included as an appendix. The report should be about 5-7 pages and should
include:

  - > A summary of why the topic you chose is relevant and interesting
    > in usable security and privacy

  - > A concise statement of your research questions and hypotheses, or
    > what it is that you hope to learn

  - > A short summary of related work on the topic

  - > An overview of the research method, the prepared study materials,
    > and any other information relevant to running the study or the
    > design of the material

  - > A recruiting plan, including target demographics for participants

  - > A description of the pilot sessions (at least 2 people) and the
    > resulting changes that were made to the research materials
