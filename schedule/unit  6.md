### A brief note about framing a research problem

In the breakout group projects that we started during class 4 and presented in class 5, we hope you all learned that:

1.  > Understanding the specifics of a problem is an essential first step and worth your time.
    
2. > Different assumptions of costs and benefits can lead to very different research designs.

Therefore, when you are pitching projects ideas, put 80% of your effort into writing a crisp and clear definition of the problem you want to investigate or hypothesis you wish to test, and then 20% of effort into
saying which research method (survey, lab study, field study, etc.) would best apply to the problem.

### Assignments due

**Submit a proposed course project idea**: Share the idea as a Google doc with at least two paragraphs, share a link to it to the course slack channel at least an hour before the sync session, and be prepared to answer questions about what you wrote during the session.

### Synchronous discussion agenda

  - Readings (30 minutes)

  - Individuals to present project ideas.

  - Students to split off into groups to discuss proposed ideas in depth.
